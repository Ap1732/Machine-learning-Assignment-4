# Machine-learning-Assignment-4

This book constitutes an in-depth foundation of k-means clustering algorithm with an application example of dealing with image compression in practical reality. It includes various important themes:It includes various important themes:

1. K-Translation Utilization: It shows step by step at which centroid the observations closer t, are assigned and the changes in centroids are made. Moreover, it illustrators the crucial reps of find_closest_centroids and compute_centroids which are responsible for updates centroids and asignment ofdata pints.

2. Application on Sample Data Set: The illustration of k-means clustering on a 2D dataset that is understandable is an exhibiting aid which allows the readers to follow the algorithm outstep with each iteration and hence see what k-means algorithm is doing.

3. Unintended Initialization: The following example explains what random initialization is and would initialize centroids by implementing a function called kMeans_init_centroids.

4. Image Compression: This exhibit the algorithms being undertaken; that are; preprocessing of an image, color identification and employment of K-means closes the distances between the pixels and their centroid, and for a picture reconstruction use these centroid.

5. Conclusions: K-means is a technique used to present efficiency in medical imaging, such as MRI and CT. The author focuses on the practically important applications in life such as image formation.

The book is a practical tutorial on the K-means clustering algorithm and provides further demonstrations of how the algorithm can be used to solve image compression as well as other tasks in various areas giving essential pointers on what research included in these areas may be about.
